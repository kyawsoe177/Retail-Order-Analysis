# Retail-Order-Analysis

The task comprises three parts, utilizing SQL, Python, and Tableau. SQL will be used to extract and prepare the data from the database. Python will assist in data cleaning, and further analysis. Tableau will be employed for data visualization and dashboard creation

## Data extraction

Firstly, the data that is going to be used for analysis was extracted from a MySQL database. It contains three tables customers, orders, and products from a retail store. Relevant information are retrieved using SQL query and exported as a dataset in a CSV file for further analysis.

## Data Cleaning, Customer Behavior Analysis and Churn Prediction 
Then, the exported dataset will be cleaned to remove inconsistencies and prepare it for analysis. This was followed by hypothesis testing of spending among different groups of customers, correlation analysis, and the development of a predictive model to forecast the churn rate of customers based on specific purchase behaviour. The entire process from data extraction and cleaning to analysis and modeling will be carried out using Python.

## Overview Dashboard
Lastly, other additional insights and patterns were visualized using Tableau to support data-driven decision-making.
